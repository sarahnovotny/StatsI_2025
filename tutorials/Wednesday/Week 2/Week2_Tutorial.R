df <- read_csv("fictional_data.csv")

# Quick overview
head(df)
str(df)
summary(df)

# Variables:
# - income: Monthly net income (numeric)
# - edu: University-level education in years (numeric)
# - cap: Binary variable (1 = lives in capital, 0 = otherwise)

# -------------------------------#
# 3. Descriptive Statistics
# -------------------------------#

### Measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (variance, sd) ###

# Income
mean_income <- mean(df$income)
median_income <- median(df$income)
var_income <- var(df$income)
sd_income <- sd(df$income)


# Education
mean_edu <- mean(df$edu)
median_edu <- median(df$edu)
var_edu <- var(df$edu)
sd_edu <- sd(df$edu)

mean_edu
median_edu
var_edu
sd_edu

# Comment:
# - Mean: average value, sensitive to outliers
# - Median: midpoint of the distribution, robust to outliers
# - Variance/SD: how spread out the values are
# - Standard Error (SE): how uncertain our estimate of the mean is


# Standard Error (SE) of the mean:
# SE = sd / sqrt(n)
# - Standard deviation (sd) measures how spread out the individual data points are.
# - Standard error (se) measures how much the sample mean itself would vary
#   if we repeatedly took new samples from the population.
#   → Larger n → smaller SE (mean estimate is more precise).
#   → Larger sd → larger SE (mean estimate is less precise).
# We use SE to build confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests.
se_income <- sd_income / sqrt(length(df$income))
se_edu <- sd_edu / sqrt(length(df$edu))

# 6. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Example
# --------------------------------------#

# The CLT tells us: the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality
# as sample size increases, regardless of the original population distribution.

set.seed(123)  # reproducibility
sample_means_n5 <- replicate(1000, mean(sample(df$income, size = 5, replace = TRUE)))

sample_means_n500 <- replicate(1000, mean(sample(df$income, size = 500, replace = TRUE)))

# Compare sampling distributions
df_clt <- data.frame(
  mean = c(sample_means_n5, sample_means_n30, sample_means_n500),
  n = factor(rep(c(5, 30, 500), each = 1000))
)

  theme_minimal()

# Interpretation:
# - With small n (5), distribution of sample means is wide and not perfectly normal.
# - With larger n (30, 500), distribution of sample means becomes narrower
#   and closer to normal, centered on the population mean.


# We learned that the sampling distribution of the mean always 
# approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original
# distribution!

# Income, for example, is usually not really normally distributed.
# First, we generate some hypothetical income data.
